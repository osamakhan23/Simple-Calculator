Simple Calculator:
This is a basic calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

How to Use:
- Clone or download the repository.
- Open the calc.html file in a web browser.
- Use the buttons to perform arithmetic operations and get the results.

Code Explanation:
The code is divided into three parts: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML
The HTML code defines the structure of the calculator. It contains a form element that contains an input element with class screen. The input element is where the results of the operations are displayed. It also contains several buttons that are used to input numbers and perform arithmetic operations.

CSS
The CSS code defines the visual appearance of the calculator. It sets the background color, font size, and border radius of the calculator, as well as the size and appearance of the buttons.

JavaScript
The JavaScript code adds interactivity to the calculator. It uses the querySelector method to select the screen, equal, and clear elements, as well as all the buttons. It then attaches event listeners to the buttons that allow the user to input numbers and operators.

The eval function is used to evaluate the mathematical expression entered by the user, and the result is displayed on the screen element when the = button is clicked.

The clear button sets the value of the screen element to an empty string, clearing the display.

Conclusion:
This simple calculator is a good example of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used together to create interactive web applications. While it is a basic implementation, it can be built upon to include more advanced features and functionality.
